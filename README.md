# Welcome to NexusLIMS!

The project serves as the development and documentation space for the back-end
of the Nexus Microscopy Facility Laboratory Information Management System
(NexusLIMS), developed by the NIST Office of Data and Informatics.
This documentation contains a number of pages that detail the processes by
which NexusLIMS harvests and combines data from multiple sources to build
a record of an experiment on a Nexus facility microscope.

These records conform to the Nexus Experimental schema, published and 
available at https://doi.org/10.18434/M32245.

## Important note

As part of the process of open-sourcing this code, a number of private internal
references to NIST infrastructure have been removed, meaning a
straight-away installation will likely not work without some tweaking.
This code is provided as an inspiration and implementation reference,
but will require some work to make it generalizable to other infrastructures
that has not yet been completed.

## Where to get help?

Most typical users will have little reason to interact directly with the
NexusLIMS back-end code contained in this repository, since it operates
completely automatically and builds experimental records without any need for
user input. There is extensive
[documentation](http://pages.nist.gov/NexusLIMS)
however, for those who wish to learn more about the nuts and bolts of how the
back-end operates.

## About the NexusLIMS logo

The logo for the NexusLIMS project is inspired by the Nobel Prize
[winning](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2011/shechtman/facts/)
work of 
[Dan Shechtman](https://www.nist.gov/content/nist-and-nobel/nobel-moment-dan-shechtman)
during his time at NIST in the 1980s. Using transmission electron
diffraction, Shechtman measured an unusual diffraction pattern that
ultimately overturned a fundamental paradigm of crystallography. He had
discovered a new class of crystals known as
[quasicrystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasicrystal), which
have a regular structure and diffract, but are not periodic.

We chose to use Shechtman’s 
[first published](https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.53.1951)
diffraction pattern of a quasicrystal as inspiration for the NexusLIMS
logo due to its significance in the electron microscopy and
crystallography communities, together with its storied NIST heritage:
